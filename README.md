MuseX is a smart space software, aimed at differentiating the teaching proposal in elementary schools, offering a special experience to children. It  proposes a 360Â° experience inside a Natural History Museum. 
In a smart interactive multi-sensory room, children can play, socialize, learn and test their knowledge about mammals, birds and geology. Our goal is to bring a fully interactive museum inside a school, where teachers can bring they students in a totally save an engaging environment.
MuseX combines the features of interactive technologies and multi sensory experiences. It uses technologies such as projectors, smart objects, body movement recognition technologies and smart lights.
Other than exploring the museum and its dioramas, three mini game are available. Children can deal with rock categorization to make a volcano erupt, habitat recognition working in team to beat the rivals and guessing the correct specie of bird collaborating to catch the right bird.
All those activities are designed to improve self-movement recognition, ability to work in group, reasoning skills and test contents learning. MuseX has a full body interaction paradigm with drag & drop, R-F-I-D reader, walk around interaction and posting gesture recognition. The Magic Room provides both audible and visual feedback that enrich MuseX experience and all the activities can be managed by the teacher using a dedicated app.
